# README-Generator

## Description
Here is a README generator that easily allows users to generate a professional README  all with a single line of code. While most of the features are working, I wasn't able to get the badge to work for the license. I'm definately going to have to go back and look it up because I kinda confused me if I'm being honest. Overall though, the code works fine and the README displays the correct information. I think some of the context on the generateMarkdown file displays a little weird and I'm having trouble making a file small enough to show the video. For that last one, Ill upload the link here:
